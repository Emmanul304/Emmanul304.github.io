<h1>What the code does</h1>
<p>
This phython code is a guessing game where the computer guesses a number and you have to guess it right. If its wrong it will tell you if your number is too low or too high and
when you get it right it while tell you if its correct and then the prgram ends. Whats special about this that it goes through a loop until you get it correct which is very important in python
</p>
<div class="guess-number">
import random
name=str(input("what is yor name?"))

correctAnswer= random.randint(1, 100)

guess=int(input("guess a guess between 1 to 100"))
while not guess == correctAnswer:
  if guess < correctAnswer:
    print("too low")
  elif guess > correctAnswer:
    print("too high")
  guess=int(input("try again"))

print("correct")
</div>
